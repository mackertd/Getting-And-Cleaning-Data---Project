# Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project (John Hopkins University - Coursera)

This repository holds the source code, Read ME, Code Book, and output for the Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course.

The course is located at https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata

# Project Overview

The purpose of the project is to produce a tidy data set as described below; a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis; and produce a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

# Data Sources

A full descrption of the data set and the ability to download is located here - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

# Files

Readme.MD - This file
CodeBook.MD - Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
run_analysis.R - R Source code that executes the analysis on the data and produces the output file
averagedDataSummary.csv - Tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

# Notes

* The code assumes that you have downloaded the data and unzipped it into a directory within the project directory called UCI_HAR_Dataset
* Output files will be placed in the project directory 
* Set the R working directory to the project directory
* Example
  * Project Directory
      * Project files (.R, .MD, etc)
      * UCI_HAR_Dataset
        * data set files and sub directories are here
